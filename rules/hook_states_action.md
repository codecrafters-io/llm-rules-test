summary: "Hook must state what the user will do (action-oriented)."
---

## Rule
- The hook must clearly state what the user will do (action-oriented).

## Good examples

* “In this stage, you’ll implement support for the PING command.”

## Bad examples

* “The PING command is used to test the connection.” (descriptive, not action-oriented)
* "This stage covers the PING command." (descriptive, not action-oriented)

## How to fix

* Keep only one sentence in the first paragraph; move any extra sentences into an Explanation section.
