## Rule
- Friendly and approachable.
- User-centric & Empathetic. 
- Neutral-professional — it doesn't get overly casual (no slang), but it avoids sounding too stiff or academic.

## Good examples
- Friendly and approachable: “In this stage, you’ll implement support for the PING command.”
- User-centric & Empathetic: “Your program should respond with `PONG` when it receives a `PING` command.”
- Neutral-professional: “The PING command is used to test the connection to the server.”

## Bad examples
- Using casual phrases like ("gotta", "no biggie", "hey there", "Besides").
- Overly casual/slang: “Hey there! In this stage, you gotta make your program handle the PING command, no biggie!”
- Too stiff/academic: “The implementer is required to add functionality for the PING command as specified in the Redis protocol.”
- Overly formal/technical: “In this particular stage of the Codecrafters Redis project, the implementer is expected to add support for the PING command, which is a fundamental command in the Redis protocol that is used to test the connection to the server and ensure that it is responsive.”
