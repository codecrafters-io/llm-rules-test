## Rule
- Instructional → Clear guidance on what the learner needs to do in this stage. 
- Explanatory → Includes background context. 
- Conversational → Uses second-person address (“you'll”, “your program should…”) to engage directly with the reader.

## Good examples
- Instructional: “In this stage, you’ll implement support for the PING command.”
- Explanatory: “The PING command is used to test the connection to the server.”
- Conversational: “Your program should respond with `PONG` when it receives a `PING` command.”

## Bad examples
- Unclear/incomplete: “Implement PING.” (lacks context and clarity)
- Overly formal/technical: “The implementer is required to add functionality for the PING command as specified in the Redis protocol.”
- Overly verbose: “In this particular stage of the Codecrafters Redis project, the implementer is expected to add support for the PING command, which is a fundamental command in the Redis protocol that is used to test the connection to the server and ensure that it is responsive.”
