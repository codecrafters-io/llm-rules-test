summary: "Content must be internally consistent and free of contradictions."
---

## Rule
- Check that there are no internal contradictions in the content.
- Don't look into examples, only the main content.

## Good examples
- Consistent terminology and definitions throughout the document.
- "A list is an ordered collection of elements." (used consistently)
- "The PING command responds with PONG." (used consistently)

## Bad examples
- Contradictory statements about the same concept.
- "A list is an unordered collection of elements." (contradicts the definition of a list)
- "The PING command responds with PING." (contradicts the actual behavior of the command)

## How to fix
- Review the content for any contradictions and ensure all statements align with established definitions and behaviors.
